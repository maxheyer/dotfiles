  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought of
  # as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter spacing

  # to your convenience but make sure to adjust 'glyph_offset' appropriately post that

  # aligned with the cursor, this is to make sure they center align.
